            Shortly after lunch on a cold December morning in 1956, a trio of New York City 
            detectives stepped out the back door of the copper-domed police headquarters looming 
            like a dirty gray temple above the tenements and trattorias of Little Italy. Across 
            the street, half-shrouded in winter shadow, a revolver-shaped sign hung outside John 
            Jovino’s, the oldest gun store in the city, if not the country, where patrolmen bought 
            the .38 Specials slung on their hips. Down the block, on the corner of Grand Street, 
            was a German restaurant called Headquarters. Under its carved mahogany ceiling, at a 
            long oak bar, the top brass took their off-duty rye and beer. 

            Today the three detectives had no time for such distractions. Led by a veteran 
            captain, Howard Finney, they walked briskly to an unmarked police cruiser, a big 
            green-and-white Plymouth idling at the curb, and drove south through the winding 
            downtown streets on an urgent errand.

            Four days earlier a bomb had exploded during a showing of War and Peace at the 
            Paramount movie palace on Flatbush Avenue, in Brooklyn. At 7:50 p.m., as an audience 
            of 1,500 gazed up at a St. Petersburg drawing room rendered in Technicolor reds and blues,
            a thundering detonation flashed from orchestra row GG, followed by billows of ashen 
            smoke. Then screams filled the theater—as moviegoers glimpsed faces and scalps scythed 
            open by shrapnel. 

            The Paramount blast was not an isolated event. Any New Yorker who read newspapers 
            knew that for 16 years the police had searched for a serial bomber who identified 
            himself only as F.P. He had planted 32 homemade explosives in the city’s most crowded 
            public spaces—theaters, terminals, subway stations, a bus depot and a library—injuring 15. 

            F.P. had yet to kill, but it was only a matter of time. The New York Journal-American, 
            an afternoon newspaper of scrappy disposition, called him “the greatest individual menace 
            New York City ever faced.” 

            In all those years, a period stretching back to 1940, the largest, most formidable 
            police force in the nation had failed to hustle up any worthy leads. Its failings 
            were forgivable as long as the bomber crafted crude and ineffective ordnance. But by 
            1956 his handiwork showed a lethal new proficiency. He declared his deadly intent in 
            letters sent to newspaper editors. Each rambling, raging letter was cryptically signed 
            “F.P.”
