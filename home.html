                Captain Finney emptied a satchel of evidence on Brussel’s desk. Out spilled 
                photographs of unexploded bombs along with photostats of strangely worded letters 
                and documentary reports amassed over 16 years. “The bombs and the letters: these 
                were all the police had,” Brussel would write. “The rest was a mystery.”
                Brussel picked through the evidence, pausing to write notes in a pad. 
                His mind assembled the possibilities as the information accrued, drawing on 
                psychiatric theory and probabilities. The evidence “showed one thing very plainly,” 
                Brussel would write. “At large somewhere in New York City was a man who was quite 
                definitely mad.”

            <p> 
                The bomber, Brussel began, was a textbook paranoid schizophrenic. People 
                suffering from this disorder, he explained, may believe other people are 
                controlling them or plotting against them. They are typically <a class="clue1" href="#"> <b> reclusive, 
                antisocial and consumed with hatred for their imagined enemies</b> </a>. For all 
                their derangement, they’re capable of acting quite normal—until, inevitably, 
                some aspect of their delusions enters into their conversation. “The paranoiac 
                is the world’s champion grudge-holder,” Brussel would explain. “We all get 
                mad at other people and organizations sometimes, but with most of us the 
                anger evaporates eventually. The paranoiac’s anger doesn’t. Once he gets the 
                idea that somebody has wronged him or is out to hurt him, the idea stays in 
                his mind. This was obviously true of the Mad Bomber.”
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                The condition, Brussel said, worsened over time, progressively clouding 
                normal logic. Most paranoids don’t become fully symptomatic until<a class="clue2" href="#"> 
                <b>after age 35</b> </a>. 
                If the bomber was about that age when he planted his first bomb, in 1940, 
                he would now be at least in his mid-40s, probably older. His guess about the 
                bomber’s age “could have been wrong,” Brussel acknowledged, “but, I thought, 
                the laws of probability were on my side.” 
            </p>
        </div>    

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                The bomber, he continued, is “symmetrically built . . . neither fat nor skinny.” 
                From across the desk Finney shot him a skeptical look. “How did you arrive at that?”
                Brussel cited a German psychiatrist, Ernst Kretschmer, who correlated body type 
                with pathologies. In a study of some 10,000 patients, he found that a majority 
                of <a class="clue3" href="#"> <b>paranoids had “athletic” bodies—medium to tall with a well-proportioned frame</b> </a>. 
                The probability was 17 in 20 that the bomber fell into that category.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                Brussel continued: Like most paranoids, F.P. felt the need to convey his 
                superiority. He did so with a self-righteous insistence on order. A fastidiousness 
                verging on prissiness showed in the letters to newspapers he’d hand-printed in 
                nearly perfect block letters free of smudges or erasures. F.P., Brussel said, 
                “was almost certainly a very neat, proper man. As an employee...he had probably 
                been exemplary. He had turned out the highest-quality work. He had shown up 
                precisely on time for work each morning. He had never been involved in brawls, 
                drunkenness or any other messy episodes. He had lived a model life—until the 
                alleged injustice, whatever it was, had occurred.”
                The same care surely applied to his grooming. <a class="clue4" href="#"> 
                <b> “He’s probably very neat, tidy, cleanshaven,” </b> </a> Brussel predicted. “He goes 
                out of his way to seem perfectly 
                proper. . . . He wears no ornament, no jewelry, no flashy ties or clothes. 
                He is quiet, polite, methodical, prompt.”                
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                To Brussel, the paranoid’s inclination to assign guilt by association explained 
                an inconsistency that had stumped the police. In his letters the bomber had <a class="clue5" href="#"> 
                <b> singled out Con Edison </b> </a>, the utility company, but he planted only the first of his bombs on 
                Con Ed property. He would see people or organizations with the remotest connection 
                to Con Ed as conspirators, no matter how illogical that might be. He might blame 
                Con Ed for some unstated offense, Brussel said, “but he twists it around so that 
                wherever a wire runs, gas or steam flows, from or to Con. Edison Co., is now a 
                bomb target.”

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                F.P.’s reliance on clunky, old-fashioned phrases, such as “dastardly deeds,” 
                erratically spaced with phrases set off by dashes, suggested a foreign background.
                “There was a certain stilted tone in the letters, a total lack of slang or American 
                colloquialisms,” Brussel would recall.<a class="clue6" href="#"> 
                <b> “Somehow the letters sounded to me as though they’d been written in a foreign 
                language and then translated into English.” </b> </a> 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                Brussel thought of the many bombings by anarchists and other radicals in Eastern 
                Europe and said, “He’s a Slav.”

                The three detectives shot Brussel a startled look. “Mind giving the reasoning behind 
                that?” Captain Finney asked.

                “Historically, bombs have been favored in Middle Europe,” Brussel answered. “So 
                have knives.” Of course, those weapons are used throughout the world. <a class="clue7" href="#"> 
                <b> “But when one man uses both, that suggests he could be a Slav.” </b> </a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                Now Brussel focused on the handwriting. The penmanship was nearly flawless, 
                as Brussel would expect from a fastidious paranoiac. F.P. had formed almost 
                perfectly rectilinear letters—with one exception. <a class="clue8" href="#"> 
                <b> The W’s looked like double U’s,  </b> </a>
                in a literal sense, with no overlapping diagonal arms. The sides were curved 
                instead of straight. They also had peculiar rounded bottoms. “The misshapen 
                W might not have caught my eye in most people’s hand-printing, but in the 
                bomber’s it stood out.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note"> 
            <p>
                A few nights later the phone rang in Brussel’s Queens home. Because he treated 
                so many violent criminals, Brussel had an unlisted number, but anybody could reach 
                him by calling Creedmoor, the psychiatric hospital where he lived. <a class="clue9" href="#"> 
                <b> The switchboard 
                forwarded calls to Brussel’s home, patching in the police if the caller sounded 
                suspicious. </b> </a> Brussel suspected that was the case when his phone rang at 1 a.m.

                “Is this Dr. Brussel, the psychiatrist?”

                “Yes, this is Dr. Brussel.”

                “This is F.P. speaking. Keep out of this or you’ll be sorry.”
